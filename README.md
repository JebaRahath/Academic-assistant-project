## The Problem

Students and researchers spend countless hours manually sifting through large PDF documents and research papers to find specific information. This time-consuming process hinders academic efficiency and makes learning more difficult than it needs to be.

## âœ¨ Our Solution

Our AI-powered academic assistant allows users to upload their study materials and start a conversation. The app leverages:
1.  **Accurate Text Extraction** to process content from uploaded PDFs.
2.  **Semantic Search** to find the most relevant text chunks that match the user's question.
3.  **Generative AI** to synthesize a direct, well-contextualized answer from the retrieved information.

This saves hours of manual work and makes study materials interactive and accessible, aligning with **SDG 4: Quality Education**.
